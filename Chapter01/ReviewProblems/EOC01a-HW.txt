Review Exercises
    1.1. Explain the difference between using a computer
    program and programming a computer.
        - Using a computer program entails being able to
        navigate the program's (oftentimes called an 'app')
        after it has already been designed through
        programming. Programming a computer, on the other
        hand, entails writing the code and (among other
        things) that delineate what a computer can do.

    1.2. Which parts of a computer can store program code?
    Which can store user data?
        - Program code can be stored in Secondary Storage
        (e.g., Hard Disk, SSD), and user data can be 
        stored in Primary Storage (i.e., Memory).

    1.3. Which parts of a computer serve to give
    information to the user? Which parts take user input?
        - Parts that give information to the user (i.e., 
        output parts) include the display screen and
        speaker. Parts that take in user input (ie..,
        input parts) include the keyboard and mouse.

    1.5. Explain the benefits of using Java over
    machine code.
        - Java can run on different operating systems
        through the use of Java virtual machines.
        - Java is readable compared to machine code
        (1s and 0s)

    1.7. What does the program print?
        - "39+3" then "42
    
    1.9. What is the compile-time error in the program?
        - the `println` method cannot take in two
        string arguments

    1.11. How do you discover syntax errors?
    How do you discover logic errors?
        - Syntax errors can be discovered using the
        error messages that are displayed after
        compile-time. Logic errors are discovered
        after comparing the actual program output with 
        the expected output for the program.
